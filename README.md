A strict Content Security Policy is applied: no inline styles, and each page gets a policy with the hashes of its own inline
scripts. See [STACK.md](STACK.md) for the reasoning behind each choice.

## Running locally

Requires Node 22.18 or newer and pnpm 10.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:3000
pnpm build      # static site in dist/client
pnpm preview    # serves dist/client on http://localhost:4173
```

## Tests and checks

```sh
pnpm check          # runs typecheck, lint, format:check, test, build, test:e2e and check:links in order
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint           # ESLint
pnpm format:check   # Prettier
pnpm test           # Vitest unit tests
pnpm test:e2e       # Playwright: every page, no-JS, theme and axe checks in light and dark (needs a build)
pnpm check:links    # crawls the build and checks every link and image
pnpm lighthouse     # mobile and desktop scores for every page
```

Playwright, Lighthouse and the screenshot script use the installed Chrome. To use Playwright's own browser instead, run
`pnpm exec playwright install chromium` and set `PW_CHANNEL=chromium`.

The build also runs its own checks (`scripts/postbuild.ts`). It fails if a page has an inline style, a page in the sitemap
was not prerendered, a link preview image is missing or the wrong size, or a CV PDF in the output differs from the one in
`public/`. Content rules in `src/content/rules.ts` are checked against the source by `tests/unit/content-rules.test.ts` and
again against the built HTML.

Other scripts: `pnpm screenshots` (full-page screenshots at three widths in light and dark, with `pnpm preview` running) and
`pnpm og-images` (redraws the link preview cards in `public/assets/og`). `pnpm wd-screens <folder>` makes the AVIF and WebP copies of the
Workout Director App Store screens in `public/assets/img/wd`; which screens are shown is set in
`src/content/workoutDirectorScreens.ts`.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on Vercel as plain static files from `dist/client`. Vercel can build it from this repository using the
settings in `vercel.json`, or a local build can be uploaded as it is, with no build step on Vercel. [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) has the details and a
post-deploy checklist.

## Project structure

```
content/
  diagrams/      Mermaid diagram sources (.mmd)
  notes/         notes in MDX, one file each
  projects/      case study text in MDX
plugins/         Vite plugins for content imports and Shiki highlighting
public/          favicons, fonts, images, CV PDFs, link preview images
scripts/         post-build checks, local server, link check, Lighthouse, screenshots
src/
  routes/        one file per page
  components/    header, footer, cards, figures, prose
  content/       site data: links, work history, projects, notes, content rules
  lib/           SEO tags, URLs, dates, sitemap, CSP
  styles/        StyleX tokens and global CSS
tests/
  unit/          Vitest
  e2e/           Playwright
```

## Adding a note

1. Create `content/notes/<slug>.mdx` with frontmatter: `title`, `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `series`, `part`, `listLabel` and
   `description`.
2. Add `/notes/<slug>/` to `sitemapPaths` in `src/content/site.ts`, and remove the title from `comingNotes` in
   `src/content/notes.ts` if it is listed there.
3. For a diagram, add a `.mmd` file to `content/diagrams`, import it in the note and use
   `<Diagram diagram={...} title="..." caption="..." />`.
4. For code, use a fenced block with a language tag. The language must be listed in `plugins/highlight.ts`.
5. Add a link preview card in `src/content/ogImages.ts` and `scripts/og-images.ts`, then run `pnpm og-images`. The build fails
   if a page's preview image is missing.
